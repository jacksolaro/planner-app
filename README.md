## About the project
This is an app that allows you to plan out your work day! The window is broken out into hour blocks from 9AM to 5PM with an area to input your tasks for each hour.

### Languages Used:
- Javascript (jQuery)

## How to Use
The Planner App works as follows:
1. Select the empty space to the right of the hour to input a To do for that block. The block shading code is as follows:
    - Gray: Past Hour
    - Red: Current Hour
    - Green: Future Hour
2. After you have inputted your To Do, you must hit the blue save button to save that to do. 
3. To Do's are saved to local storage, so you can close the page or refresh and your to do will remain

## Future Scope:
- Add option to add tasks for future dates
- Automatically save tasks without clicking the save button
- Add option to add DISTINCTIVE tasks within each hour
- Add task status option
